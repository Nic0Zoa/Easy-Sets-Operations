# Easy-Sets-Operations

It is just a bunch of sets operations, like union, intersection and difference of sets. All of this programmed in C.

The purpose of this was learning how to use the typical data strcutres used in programming applied on C. As well as pointers, arrays, lists, etc.


## Bonus

Also there is an option for sorting the set, even though sets do not have an intrisic order property, my professor just asked to code that.
